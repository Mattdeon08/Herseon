# html-css-challenge
The obvjective of this challenge was to make the page more accessible by changing elements to be easier to ready by both the user and the browser.

This being my my first challenge I wanted to do well and also get some good pratice. Being new to coding I dont have the best understanding of which element to use and were when structuring the code so I had to overcome this by useing both google search and the prework study guide to remember which steps to take and in what order. It was a true challenge for me at first and i even had to start over a couple of times due to not setting up my repo correctly but by having to do this the steps became more naterual and my understanding HTML did improve im not sure i changed everything that needed to be modified but i was glade to be challenged and look forward to continueing to learn. 

To do the challenge I noticed that all section were labled as div so after googleing what to do to make the page more accessible i saw that div is general and makes it hard for the computer to know wht to do with this info so i modigied the heaer, i added a nav section for navigation bar and labled some of the div as sections and lastly added a footer element. After doing this i saw that it changed the web page in the browser in a bad way. Then I figured out that I had to update the style.css to have these elements included so that the page could maintaine it's look. next I add the alt atributes to the images and finally I created my readme.md
